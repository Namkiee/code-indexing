# Evaluation of Task A6: Request-ID middleware & structured JSON logging

## Summary
- `RequestIdMiddleware` now wraps all responses—successful, FastAPI `HTTPException`, and unexpected errors—with the `X-Request-ID` header while emitting status-aware structured logs.
- `/v1/search` INFO logs capture the query, tenant, repo, latency, cache status, and A/B variant, and DEBUG logs include candidate chunk diagnostics to aid troubleshooting.

## Verification
1. **Header propagation on failure paths**
   - Added unit coverage that exercises FastAPI routes raising both `HTTPException` and generic exceptions; in each case the response preserves/creates the request ID header and returns structured JSON with the status code.
2. **Search observability**
   - Updated the endpoint to emit `search_started`, `search_completed`, and `search_candidates` events with the required metadata. Cache hits reuse the stored variant/search ID so downstream systems can correlate telemetry consistently.

## Conclusion
All A6 acceptance criteria are satisfied. Mark task A6 as completed on the roadmap.
